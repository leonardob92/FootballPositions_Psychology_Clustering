Abstract
Elite football performance depends not only on physical abilities but also on advanced cognition and personality traits. While previous studies have shown psychological differences between elite players and controls, it remains unclear whether such differences also distinguish players by tactical role. We assessed 123 top-tier Brazilian footballers and 124 matched controls using a comprehensive battery of cognitive and personality tests, including executive functions and Big Five traits. Unsupervised Gaussian mixture modelling identified three psychological clusters. One cluster, characterized by lower executive function, predominantly comprised controls. The two elite clusters showed distinct profiles: Cluster 1, common among defenders, was marked by higher extraversion, lower openness, and elevated cognitive abilities relative to controls. Cluster 2, associated with strikers, showed high openness and conscientiousness, along with superior executive functioning compared to both controls and defenders. Midfielders were distributed across both clusters. In addition, the clusters predicted football performance metrics, with Cluster 1 linked to defensive actions (e.g., interceptions, challenges) and Cluster 2 linked to offensive output (e.g., dribbles, goals, assists). These findings reveal that elite footballers are psychologically diverse, forming subtypes that align with positional demands, with implications for role-tailored talent development and training.

The code was developed by Leonie Balter.
